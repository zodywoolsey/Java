# Java
This is the readme. I have never made one before and this is my first project ever that was designed to be backed up with github.

I am a student and this entire "Project" (if you can call it that) will just be me testing different things as I continue through my Java class in college.

These lines are super long and I hope reapping works in the display......... Oh, Ok, Yeah it does. I forgot that there is a preview button.

This will likely be continued for as long as I remember how to update git and can. I am hoping to store all of my future java testing here, so if you think I am good at this or something (first off please hire me) stay tuned.

if you want to ask me questions...... this might be a bad idea..... actually, I am going to create a secondary email real quick. BRB.

For questions and contact please email: dontcallmeachair@gmail.com

btw my name is Zody and if you google that there is some dumb chair company that I don't like because they won't send me a chair.... My parents made up my name, no story, no magical family meaning or anything and it just so happens to be the same as this "Zody" chair company and I need a better office chair soooooooooooooooooooooo.

Wow that got really off topic. I'll probably update this file too, if I remember, so that y'all know what is up.
